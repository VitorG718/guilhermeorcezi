### "OlÃ¡ pessoas!" \o/ ðŸ‘‹

My name is Guilherme Orcezi, I'm from Brazil (ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·) and I'm 20. I'm studying Systems Analysis and Development, interested in fullstack technology. I've been studying a lot about NodeJS and React, enjoying everything that wonderful Javascript has to offer, as I see a promising future for this stack with React Native on mobile.

Would you like to find me?
